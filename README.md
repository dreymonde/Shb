# Shb

[![Carthage compatible](https://img.shields.io/badge/Carthage-compatible-4BC51D.svg?style=flat)](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) [![MIT licensed](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hyperium/hyper/master/LICENSE)

A Swift helper for generating Sunrise, Sunset and Shabbat times. Fork of [ceeK/Solar](https://github.com/ceeK/Solar). 

In **Shb** (as opposed to **Solar**), a `Solar` is a generic type, thus giving the ability to provide custom calculation (zenith) information.

**Shb** performs its calculations locally using an algorithm from the [United States Naval Observatory](http://williams.best.vwh.net/sunrise_sunset_algorithm.htm), and thus does not require the use of a network.

## Usage

### Sunrise/sunset

Solar simply needs a date and a location specified as a latitude and longitude:

```swift
let solar = USNOSolar(date: someDate, latitude: 51.528308, longitude: -0.1340267)
let sunrise = solar.sunrise
let sunset = solar.sunset
```

Note that all dates are UTC. Don't forget to format your date into the appropriate timezone if required.

### Shabbat times

```swift
let shabbat = Shb(date: someDate, latitude: 31.771959, longitude: 35.217018)
let candles = shabbat.lightCandles
let start = shabbat.shabbatStarts
let ends = shabbat.shabbatEnds
```

### Providing your own calculation info

```swift
public enum CustomCalc : SolarCalculation {
    
    case civilSunset
    
    public var zenith: Double {
        return 96
    }
    
    public var sunriseSunset: SunriseSunset {
        return .sunset
    }
    
}
```

```swift
let customSolar = Solar<CustomCalc>(date: someDate, latitude: 31.771959, longitude: 35.217018)
let civilSunset = customSolar.calculate(.civilSunset)
```

### Types of sunrise and sunset

There are several types of sunrise and sunset that Solar generates. They differ by how many degrees the sun lies below the horizon:

- **Official** (~0째)

- **Civil** (6째 below horizon)

- **Nautical** (12째 below horizon)

- **Astromonical** (18째 below horizon)

## Installation

**Shb** is available through Carthage. 

### Carthage

Add the `dreymonde/Shb` project to your [Cartfile](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage/blob/master/Documentation/Artifacts.md#cartfile)

```ruby
github "dreymonde/Shb"
```

Then run `carthage update`
